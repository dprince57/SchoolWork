In this lab we make some updates to the pbm program that we worked on in class.

The files in this directory were copied from ~cs500/public_html/pbm/

You should do all of the tasks that are labeled lab5 in comments in the code.
A correct working version of my compiled code is in the SOLUTION directory
of this assignment. You should run my program to see how it is supposed to work.

You should match the formatting and output of my program exactly.

You can also use the hwcheck option to check your program's output against
mine on test inputs. You do this...

make
submit --hwcheck


Points/grading... You should work on the program in the following order,
and each part is worth the given # of points.
1) --help usage statement: 1 pt
2) read from argv[1] rather than always CHES-1-like: 1 pt
3) --print: 1 pt
4) --row_count: 1 pt
5) --max_escore, --min_escore: 2 pts
6) --avg_escore: 2 pts
7) --large_escore: 2 pts
7) --small_escore: 2 pts
8) free: 2 pts


Note that your program should also have a correct pbm_free function, so
there are not any memory leaks. You can run the following to check your
program.

valgrind --leak-check=full ./pbm_driver.o /u1/junk/kinne/ahmad-lab/data_files/CHES-1-like_8mers_11111111.txt --max_escore
