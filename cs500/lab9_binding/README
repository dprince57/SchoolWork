Lab9 - Project. For this lab, you will complete the TODO items marked in
binding_region.c.  I suggest working on them in the following order:

1) pbms_* functions - these are functions to keep a list of pbm structures. This
will be very similar to the brs_* functions that are in the file already for
keeping a list of br regions.

2) mutations_* functions - these are functions to keep a list of mutation structures.
This will be very similar to the brs_* functions that are in the file already
for keeping a list of br regions.

3) seq_print_pbms_brs - this function is used to print the sequence along with
the escore information and binding sites. The part for the escores and binding
sites are pretty well separate, so you can do the escores part first, and once
that is working, then do the binding site part.

4) br_seq_mutate - this is the function that should loop through all possible
mutations and find the best one. Note that even if you don't get seq_print_pbms_brs
working properly, you can still work on br_seq_mutate (they are independent of
each other).  For br_seq_mutate, you will use the functions in combinations.c/.h
to loop over all combinations of positions in the sequence to try mutating. And
you will use the functions in all_values.c/.h to loop over all possible letter
values these positions could change to. You should follow the outline of the comments
left in the function.

Jeff's correct working version is in the SOLUTION directory. If you find any problems
with it, let me know.



Below is information about the data files we are using. This is FYI, you can ignore this if you like.

PBM files were downloaded from UniProbe - http://the_brain.bwh.harvard.edu/uniprobe/browse.php

Note that according to the readme.txt files when you download the PBM data, the columns in the pbm files are:
   1: 8-mer sequence
   2: complement of 8-mer sequence
   3: Enrichment Score
   4: Median Intensity Signal
   5: z-scores calculated from the median SI data.

The dna sequence file CG5080-WT.asc appears to be from a region of the CG5080 gene in the 2L chromosome of D. mel. Note that a BLAST of the sequence gives a 100% match starting at position 1162075 of the 2L gene.  
You can view this match in a genome browser (as of 1/30/2023) here -

The CG5080-WT.asc sequence seems to be from an intron of the gene.
