Each of the files in this directory is a program from the
~/public_html/C_basics/ directory - a
program that we did in class at some point.

Each file has some comments indicating what you should do to modify
the program for lab8. If there are print statements in comments, then
you should use these in your final program.

When the assignment is released, there is not a hwcheck available, but
there will be one by the time the assignment is due.
