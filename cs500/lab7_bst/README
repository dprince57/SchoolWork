You need to make your program match the behavior of my program that you can
run in the SOLUTION directory. The last few options when you run it with -h
are the new ones you need to implement. Check the class recording from
April 3 on getting started and some tips.

Note that you do not have a hwcheck available to use for testing your program,
but I probably will use a hwcheck with grading. So you need to make sure your
program behaves exactly the same as the one in the SOLUTION directory - same
exact output, same exact behavior.
