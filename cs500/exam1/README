You will hand in your programs for the programming part of the midterm exam using this assignment. Your canvas exam will have the questions you need to complete, you will modify the appropriate files in this directory as asked, and hand in using handin.

Note - you can use the files in this directory as your starting points, or you can copy over your own versions of the files if you prefer. The files in this directory are just the same as the starting points for lab4 and lab5, which is enough to complete the exam.
