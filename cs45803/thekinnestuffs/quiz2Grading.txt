Grading information for Quiz2.
20 points total.

Each of the 4 problems was graded out of 1 point.  The total was added
up and written on the lower-right hand corner of the back of the
paper.  Then this value is multiplied by 5 and put into blackboard.

1) 0, 1/2, or 1 point.
1 - correct final solution and work showing how derived.
1/2 - something correct was said and set up, but went wrong somewhere
      along the way.
0 - did not set the problem up right at all.


2) There were 6 functions.  Grade was given for longest chain of 
   functions that were all in the right order.  So, if there was a 
   subset of 4 functions on your list that was correct, you'd 
   get 4/6.


3) 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1.
1 - correct answer and derivation.
2/3 - most of the derivation is correct.
1/2 - some of the setup is correct, but then it goes wrong somewhere.
1/3 - tried to apply the master theorem, and did it correct except
      fact that a = n is not a constant, came up with n^(log n) as answer.

4) 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1.
1 - correct on both parts of the problem.
2/3 - one of the two parts was right, and the other was close.
1/2 - one of the two parts right, the other wrong.
1/3 - some things that were on the right track, but not correct on 
      either part.
