* 15 points total.
* full credit if you met with me, having something along the lines
  of what I suggested, and have it documented
* -3 if you don't have documented what your progress is.
* 10/15 if you have something copied from the internet, but there 
  is no documentation from you about how it works, how to run it, etc.
* 8/15 if there is something, but it doesn't look like much yet.
* 5/15 if there is something but shows very minimal effort.
