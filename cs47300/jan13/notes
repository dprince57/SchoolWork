Layers:

 * Application layer
 * TCP/UDP layer
   - TCP is persistent (Stays up), reliable, sequenced
   - UDP is one way, one packet, unreliable
 * IP layer
 * Hardware layer

Client task:
 * Prepare a sockaddr_in
   - type AF_INET
   - address (IP): 32-bit unsigned int
     * IPV4 is 32-bit, IPV6 is 128-bit
   - port : 16-bit unsigned short int (network byte order)
 * Create a socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,)

Server stuff:
 * socket
   - same as client
 * bind (almost the same as connect)
 * listen
   - accepting new connections
 * loop:
   - check for new connections
   - has anyone sent me anything? (read if yes)
   - process the data just read
   - does anyone need to be written to? (write if yes)
   - handle exceptions (disconnecting)
   - sleep
