Wireless
--------
  electromagnetic radiation
    light
    xrays
    radio waves
    microwaves

  photon
  wave
    frequency (# of oscillations per second)
    wavelength
      frequency * wavelength = speed of light
      wf = c

Three classes of methods for encoding data:
-------------------------------------------
  amplitude (changing the power of the signal)
  frequency
    one Hz = 1 cycle per second
    2.415 GHz (wi-fi) = 2.415 billion cycles per second
    2.415 GHz = channel 1
      2.404 to 2.426 is the range of frequencies for (standard) wi-fi
      how you exchange data changing frequncies
  phase
    4 out-of-phase signals pieced together for different values

Encryption
----------
  WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy (IEEE 802.11)
    encryption algorithm called RC4
      Rivest (R from RSA)
      stream cipher
    plaintext sequence of bytes
    stream cipher generates random sequence of bytes
      XOR bytes together from sequences together
    key = shared key + Initialization Vector (IV) [24-bit rand #]
