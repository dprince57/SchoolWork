Dijkstra's

Priority Queue:
  -remove item with highest priority
  - insert item

heap : a binary tree satisfying each node has priority >= priority of 
       each child
  -upheap - compare priority with parent, exchange if nesscessary, 
            repeat
  -downheap - compare priority with children, if child has greater 
              priority, exchange with greater child repeat if necessary

dijkstra's

initialize priority queue
for all vertices v;
  dist[v] = infit
dist[s] = 0
insert(s)
while PQ not empty:
  u = remove();
  for each neighbor v of u;
    tmp = dist[u] + edge(u,v)
    if tmp < deist[v] then
       dist[v] = tmp
       insert(v);



Pwhat if exoo is watching?
