1. Define a command that does one of the following:
   - lists the contents of file /etc/passwd
   - lists all the subdirectories in the directory /u1/class
2. Define a regex pattern using r string that finds all student accounts. Make sure your regex pattern returns no error
   during compilation by using exception handling.         
3. use a subprocess to call your command
4. Make sure to consider handling exceptions with subprocess.
5. Take the output of your command and use it with regular expression in order to find all student accounts. You will need    
   to split your subprocess standard output in order to use it with regex search function. Be careful in case you use
   findall function as it might give duplicates if you use /etc/passwd.
